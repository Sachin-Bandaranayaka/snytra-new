# User Story: Fix Registration Form Validation Error

## Story ID: REG-VAL-001

## Title
Fix "Validation failed" error in business registration form when all checkboxes are checked

## Description
As a business user trying to register for an account, I want the registration form to work correctly when I check all required legal compliance checkboxes, so that I can successfully create my business account without encountering validation errors.

## Problem Statement
Users are experiencing a "Validation failed" error during the business registration process even when they have checked all required checkboxes (Terms of Service and Privacy Policy). The error occurs at step 4 (Legal & Compliance) of the registration form.

## Root Cause
There was a field name mismatch between the frontend and backend:
- **Frontend** was sending: `termsAccepted` and `privacyAccepted`
- **Backend** was expecting: `acceptTerms` and `acceptPrivacyPolicy`

This caused the Zod validation schema on the backend to fail, resulting in a 400 Bad Request error.

## Solution
Updated the frontend `RegisterForm.tsx` to map the field names correctly when sending data to the API:

```typescript
legalCompliance: {
  acceptTerms: legalCompliance.termsAccepted,
  acceptPrivacyPolicy: legalCompliance.privacyAccepted,
  marketingOptIn: legalCompliance.marketingOptIn
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] User can check both required checkboxes (Terms of Service and Privacy Policy)
- [x] Form validation passes when both required checkboxes are checked
- [x] Registration API call succeeds with proper field mapping
- [x] User can successfully complete business registration
- [x] Optional marketing checkbox works correctly

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/app/register/RegisterForm.tsx` - Fixed field name mapping in registration data

### API Endpoint
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Complex registration schema validation

### Validation Schema (Backend)
```typescript
legalCompliance: z.object({
    acceptTerms: z.boolean().refine(val => val === true, {
        message: "You must accept the terms and conditions"
    }),
    acceptPrivacyPolicy: z.boolean().refine(val => val === true, {
        message: "You must accept the privacy policy"
    }),
    // ... other fields
})
```

## Testing
1. Navigate to `/register`
2. Complete steps 1-3 of the registration form
3. On step 4, check both required checkboxes:
   - "I agree to the Terms of Service"
   - "I agree to the Privacy Policy"
4. Click "Create account"
5. Verify registration completes successfully without validation errors

## Priority
**High** - This blocks user registration and affects business growth

## Story Points
**2** - Simple field mapping fix

## Definition of Done
- [x] Code changes implemented and tested
- [x] Registration form works end-to-end
- [x] No validation errors when checkboxes are properly checked
- [x] User can successfully create business account
- [x] Story documented for future reference
