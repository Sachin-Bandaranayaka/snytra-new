# Snytra Restaurant Management System - SaaS Pricing Packages Rebuild PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
- **Source**: IDE-based fresh analysis of existing codebase
- **Project Documentation**: Existing brownfield architecture document available
- **Analysis Date**: Current session analysis

### Current Project State
Snytra is a comprehensive restaurant management system built as a SaaS platform. The system currently includes:
- User authentication and registration system
- Admin panel with subscription management
- Existing pricing page displaying subscription plans
- Basic Stripe payment integration
- Restaurant management features (menu, orders, reservations, staff)
- Multi-tenant architecture supporting multiple restaurant businesses

**Current Issue**: The existing pricing package creation system exists but is not functioning properly as a complete SaaS solution. Users can view pricing plans but the subscription flow, access control, and Stripe integration are incomplete or broken.

### Available Documentation Analysis

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
- ✓ Major Feature Modification
- ✓ Integration with New Systems (Complete Stripe integration)
- ✓ New Feature Addition (SaaS access control)
- ✓ Bug Fix and Stability Improvements

#### Enhancement Description
Rebuild the pricing package creation and management system to function as a complete SaaS solution where users must purchase subscription packages through Stripe to access the restaurant management system, with proper free trial functionality and access control.

#### Impact Assessment
- ✓ Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)
- ✓ Major Impact (architectural changes required for access control)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Create a fully functional SaaS pricing package creation system in the admin panel
- Implement complete Stripe payment integration for subscription purchases
- Establish proper access control preventing non-subscribers from accessing business features
- Enable free trial functionality with automatic conversion to paid subscriptions
- Ensure seamless user experience from pricing page to subscription activation
- Maintain existing restaurant management functionality for subscribed users

#### Background Context
The current system has the foundation of a SaaS platform but lacks the critical components that make it function as a true subscription-based service. Users can register and view pricing plans, but there's no enforcement of subscription requirements to access the core restaurant management features. The Stripe integration exists but is incomplete, and the admin panel's package creation system doesn't properly sync with Stripe products and prices. This enhancement will transform the existing system into a fully functional SaaS platform where subscription management is central to the user experience.

2. Loading states must follow the current spinner and skeleton loading conventions
3. Success/error notifications must integrate with the existing toast notification system
4. Modal dialogs for subscription actions must match the current modal styling and behavior
5. Responsive design must maintain the existing mobile-first approach and breakpoint system

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
**Frameworks**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS
**Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
**Authentication**: NextAuth.js
**Payment Processing**: Stripe API v2023-10-16
**Infrastructure**: Vercel deployment, Neon PostgreSQL
**External Dependencies**: Stripe SDK, Heroicons, various utility libraries

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Extend existing Prisma schema with enhanced subscription tables, implement migrations for new fields, maintain referential integrity with existing user and company data

**API Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing `/api/subscription-plans` endpoints, add new Stripe webhook handlers, implement middleware for subscription verification on protected routes

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Extend existing React components with subscription-aware logic, implement new subscription management components using existing design patterns, add subscription status context throughout the application

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Implement unit tests for subscription logic, integration tests for Stripe workflows, end-to-end tests for complete subscription flows using existing testing framework

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow existing Next.js App Router structure, place subscription components in `/src/components/subscription/`, add subscription utilities in `/src/lib/subscription/`, maintain API routes in `/src/app/api/` hierarchy

**Naming Conventions**: Maintain existing camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components, kebab-case for file names, follow established database naming with snake_case

**Coding Standards**: Continue using TypeScript strict mode, maintain existing ESLint configuration, follow established error handling patterns, use existing utility functions for database operations

**Documentation Standards**: Document all new subscription-related functions with JSDoc, maintain inline comments for complex subscription logic, update API documentation for new endpoints

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Leverage existing Vercel deployment pipeline, ensure Stripe environment variables are properly configured, maintain existing build optimization settings

**Deployment Strategy**: Implement feature flags for gradual rollout, use database migrations for schema changes, coordinate Stripe webhook endpoint updates with deployment

**Monitoring and Logging**: Extend existing logging patterns for subscription events, implement Stripe webhook monitoring, add subscription metrics to existing analytics

**Configuration Management**: Manage Stripe keys through existing environment variable system, implement configuration validation for subscription settings, maintain separation between development and production Stripe accounts

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Stripe webhook reliability and duplicate event handling
- Database migration complexity with existing user data
- Performance impact of subscription checks on every request

**Integration Risks**:
- Breaking existing user authentication flows
- Disrupting current payment processing for restaurant orders
- Conflicts between subscription and restaurant-specific Stripe usage

**Deployment Risks**:
- Webhook endpoint configuration during deployment
- Environment variable synchronization across environments
- Database migration rollback complexity

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Implement comprehensive webhook event deduplication
- Create detailed rollback procedures for database migrations
- Use feature flags to enable subscription features gradually
- Implement circuit breakers for Stripe API calls
- Create comprehensive test suite covering all subscription scenarios

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with sequential story implementation to minimize risk to existing system functionality while building complete SaaS subscription capabilities.
